## Driving SMARTS Competition
Driving SMARTS Competition aims to heighten research attention from the machine learning (ML) community to challenges resulting from distribution shift in diverse dynamic interaction contexts prevalent in real-world autonomous driving (AD). Regardless of the solution methods, be it reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning (IL), or classical planning and control, such challenges must be adequately addressed so that autonomous driving could see broader deployment, allowing more humanlike or human-friendly behavior, and allowing principled investigation into the opportunities and dangers in large scale deployment of autonomous cars into the open social enviornment of our streets and roads.
