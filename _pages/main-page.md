## The Competition

Autonomous Driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in a competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. in autonomous decision making.

The goal for the agent is to drive as quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Scenarios are created from real-world data and represent many typical driving tasks, including cruising, merging, overtaking, unprotected left turns, turns at unsignalized intersections, and following another vehicle.

There are two tracks in the competition.

**Track 1**: The participants are free to use any method and training data they like to develop their solutions. 

**Track 2**: The partcipants are only allowed to train their methods on the offline datasets.

**Bonus task**: Track 1 includes a *fast adaptation task*. The goal is to learn from a small sample of new tasks. To test this, the submissions that selected to participate in this task will be trained on a small unseen dataset.

Winners in each track will receive cash prizes and will get a chance to present their innovative solutions during the virtual ceremony.

Let’s get these cars moving!

## Competition Timeline
The NeurIPS 2022 Driving SMARTS competition is a programming competition organised by Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. You pick your team to work together, and we pick a competition in the field of Artificial Intelligence for you to solve.

Are you up for the challenge?

Aug. 1, 2022: competition opens.
* Nov. 1, 2022: competition closes at 11:59pm Pacific Time.
* Nov. 5, 2022: finalists will be announced and will be asked to submit their code.
* Nov. 20, 2022: winning teams announced.
* Nov. 20, 2022: winning teams are invited to submit a short report of their proposed approach. The final rank of the winning teams will be determined by the Academic Committee based on the leaderboard scores from automated evaluation and the techinical merits of their solutions.

## Rules
The Terms & Conditions for the NeurIPS Competition gather all rules that apply to the organisers and participants of the competition. You can find a summary of the most important ones below:

### Eligibility
To be eligible to enter the competition, all Participants must

at the date of submission of the competition entry, you can register the competition through an email address which the Organiser can communicate with the Participant in connection with the competition;
either be single entrant or part of a team of up to a maximum of three (3) members only; and
be solely responsible for creating the competition submission, though supervision or advice from the Participants’ professors or post-doctoral researchers is permissible.

### How to enter
The competition registration opens on early July 2022. The Competition itself commences on the 1st of August 2022 and ends at midnight on 1st November 2022 (the Deadline). Any competition submission after the Deadline will be automatically disqualified.

The following describes how entries to the competition can be made:

- the individual Participant or, if a team is entering, a member of that team as its representative on behalf of the others, must register with the Organiser through this website;
- the Organiser will then send via email to the *registered* email address provided at registration an email which will include a guide to the third party evaluation system used to run the competition (the 'Evaluation System').
- the Participant will be provided login details to the third party Evaluation System in order to be able to gain access to the competition and submit a competition entry. Please note that your use of the Evaluation System is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of the operator of that system;

### Evalutaion
- The Organizer will evaluate submissions for Track 1 and 2 using the submitted pre-trained models and inference doe on the witheld test set. Six finalists will be selected in each track.
- Those finalists in Track 1 who chose the bonus task will be asked to provide their training code. The Organizer will inspect the code, train and evaluate the models on the withheld data. The overall performance on the test set and bonus task will determine the three winners of Track 1.
- The Organizer will work with the participants who selected the bonus task or Track 2 to run their training code, participants may be asked to provide additional documentation to facilitate this process.
- The winners of Track 2 will be determined based on the performance of the models trained by the Organizer.

The organizers will provide a simulation engine binary for participants to train on. Participants are to use their own method(s) to ensure that their car can successfully accomplish the task.

Participants shall submit their models for testing and evaluation to generate a leader board included in the evaluation system. During the test, models are tested on environments where traffic conditions and order varies.
Participants can use any deep learning framework they wish (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch). However, any cheating by using commercial tools, and these results are not permitted and any such entries will be disqualified. Top performing teams on the leader-board will be required to provide their code to the Organiser, who will run the code to verify that it reproduces the same results as submitted by the Participants to the competition and to otherwise verify that the submission is valid.

Participants are permitted to submit a maximum of 2 entries a day only to the competition. To be clear if a team enters, this maximum of entries is 2 times of the number the members.
