## The Competition

Autonomous driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in an autonomous driving competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. and academic collaborators.

This competition seeks to advance development of autonomous driving agents. We selecte that can drive as quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Scenarios are created from real-world data and represent many typical driving tasks, including cruising, merging, overtaking, cut-ins, unprotected left turns and turns at unsignalized intersections.

### Competition tracks
There are two tracks in the competition.

**Track 1**: The participants may use *any* method and training data to develop their solutions. 

**Bonus task**: Track 1 includes a *fast adaptation task*. The goal is to learn from a small sample of new tasks. To test this, the submissions that selected to participate in this task will be trained on a small unseen dataset.

**Track 2**: The partcipants are only allowed to train their methods on the *offline datasets*.

Winners in each track will receive cash prizes and will get a chance to present their innovative solutions during the virtual ceremony.

## General Rules

- Participants can be a single entrant or part of a team;
- Participants must be registered for the competition prior to submitting an entry;
- Participants must be solely responsible for creating the submission (receiving supervision or advice from supervisors or colleagues is permitted);
- Participants must be able to share their training and inference code and trained models with the organizers;
- For the participants or a team to be eligible for receiving awards, each member must satisfy the following conditions:
  - be at least 18 years old or age of majority in place of residence;
  - not be an organizer of this competition nor a family member of a competition organizer.
- Participants can submit entries to both tracks; performance in each track will be evaluated separately. Submissions between tracks are not linked.
- Any submissions entered after the Deadline will be automatically disqualified.
- Official rule clarifications will be made in the FAQ section on the CodaLab competition website.

### Determining the winners
- Submissions for Track 1 will be automatically evaluated on a test set and the results will be posted on the public leaderboard hosted on CodaLab.
- The finalists in Track 1 who shose the bonus track will be asked to provide their training code. The Organizer will inspect the code, train and evaluate the models on the withheld test data. The overall performance on the test set and bonus task will determine the three winners of Track 1.
- The Organizer will evaluate submissions for Track 1 and 2 using the submitted pre-trained models and inference doe on the witheld test set. Six finalists will be selected in each track.
- The winners of Track 2 will be determined based on the performance of the models trained by the Organizer.
- The Organizer will work with the participants who selected the bonus task or Track 2 to run their training code, participants may be asked to provide additional documentation to facilitate this process.


Participants shall submit their models for testing and evaluation to generate a leader board included in the evaluation system. During the test, models are tested on environments where traffic conditions and order varies.
Participants can use any deep learning framework they wish (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch). However, any cheating by using commercial tools, and these results are not permitted and any such entries will be disqualified. Top performing teams on the leader-board will be required to provide their code to the Organiser, who will run the code to verify that it reproduces the same results as submitted by the Participants to the competition and to otherwise verify that the submission is valid.
Participants are permitted to submit a maximum of 2 entries a day only to the competition. To be clear if a team enters, this maximum of entries is 2 times of the number the members.

## About Noah’s Ark Lab
[About Huawei]()

The Noah’s Ark Lab is the AI research center for Huawei Technologies, located in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an, London, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, etc.

The mission of the lab is to make significant contributions to both the company and society by innovating in artificial intelligence, data mining and related fields. Mainly driven by long term and big impact projects, research in the lab also tries to advance the state of the art in the fields as well as to harness the products and services of the company, at each stage of the innovation process.

As a world class research lab, we are pushing the frontier of research and development in all areas that we work in.We dare to address both the challenges and opportunities in this era of AI and big data, to revolutionize the ways in which people work and live, and the ways in which companies do business, through intelligentization of all processes, with the slogan 'from big data to deep knowledge'.

Research areas of the lab include computer vision, natural language processing, search & recommendation, decision and reasoning ,AI theory. Founded in 2012, the lab has now grown to be a research organization with many significant achievements in both academia and industry. We welcome talented researchers and engineers to join us to realize their dreams.
