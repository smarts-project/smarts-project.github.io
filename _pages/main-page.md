## The Competition

Autonomous Driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in a competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. in autonomous decision making.

Accelerate your future
There are two separate tracks in the competition. Track 1 is focused on single-agent multi-lane cruising, Track 2 is focused on multi-agent safe driving. Your goal is to design an autonomous algorithm that is capable of driving safely and efficiently across a variety of simulated maps containing numerous tasks, such as merging, intersections, high-ways, and many others. We offer such scenarios through a simulator that emulates real-world traffic at a variety of granularity levels.

Winners will be announced in a ceremony, where cash prize will be provided with the winner certificate. You will also get the chance to teach us all about your innovations in a spot-light talk during the event.

Let’s get these cars moving!

## Competition Timeline
The DAI 2020 SMARTS Competition of Autonomous Driving is a programming competition organised by Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. You pick your team to work together, and we pick a competition in the field of Artificial Intelligence for you to solve.

Are you up for the challenge?

Aug. 14, 2020: competition opens.
* Oct. 14, 2020: competition closes at 11:59pm Pacific Time.
* Oct. 19, 2020: winning teams announced.
* Oct. 25: top-5 teams of each track will be invited to give an online technical presentation at the DAI 2020 conference.
The final rank of the winning teams will be determined by the Academic Committee based on the leaderboard scores from automated evaluation, the techinical merits of the solutions, and the quality of the technical presentation at the DAI conference.

## Eligibility
To be eligible to enter the competition, all Participants must

at the date of submission of the competition entry, you can register the competition through an email address which the Organiser can communicate with the Participant in connection with the competition;
either be single entrant or part of a team of up to a maximum of three (3) members only; and
be solely responsible for creating the competition submission, though supervision or advice from the Participants’ professors or post-doctoral researchers is permissible.

### How to enter
The competition registration opens on 14th August 2020. The Competition itself commences on 14th August 2020 and ends at midnight on 14th October 2020 (the 'Dead-line'). Any competition submission after the Deadline will be automatically disqualified.

The following describes how entries to the competition can be made:

- the individual Participant or, if a team is entering, a member of that team as its representative on behalf of the others, must register with the Organiser through this website;
- the Organiser will then send via email to the *registered* email address provided at registration an email which will include a guide to the third party evaluation system used to run the competition (the 'Evaluation System').
- the Participant will be provided login details to the third party Evaluation System in order to be able to gain access to the competition and submit a competition entry. Please note that your use of the Evaluation System is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of the operator of that system;

### The Simulator & Evaluation System
The organizers will provide a simulation engine binary for participants to train on. Participants are to use their own method(s) to ensure that their car can successfully accomplish the task.

Participants shall submit their models for testing and evaluation to generate a leader board included in the evaluation system. During the test, models are tested on environments where traffic conditions and order varies.
Participants can use any deep learning framework they wish (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch). However, any cheating by using commercial tools, and these results are not permitted and any such entries will be disqualified. Top performing teams on the leader-board will be required to provide their code to the Organiser, who will run the code to verify that it reproduces the same results as submitted by the Participants to the competition and to otherwise verify that the submission is valid.

Participants are permitted to submit a maximum of 2 entries a day only to the competition. To be clear if a team enters, this maximum of entries is 2 times of the number the members.
