## The Competition

Autonomous driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in an autonomous driving competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. and academic collaborators.

## The competition is now live at codalab:
# [2022 Neurips Driving SMARTS Competition](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/6618)


### Tasks and evaluation
This competition seeks to advance autonomous driving by developing agents that can drive as quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Data for the competition consists of large-scale naturalistic driving data replayed within [SMARTS](https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS/tree/comp-1) simulation environment. The following typical driving scenarios are tested: cruising, overtaking, merging, left turns at unsignalized intersections and being cut off by another vehicle. These scenarios are mined from the naturalistic data, manipulated and replayed in SMARTS. For some scenarios, interactive background vehicles are added in SMARTS.

Agents will be ranked according to their safety (number of collisions and traffic rule violations), task completion (% of completed scenarios), human-likeness (measured as jerkiness, acceleration, and lateral distance to surrounding vehicles), and completion time.

### Competition tracks
There are two tracks in the competition.

**Track 1**: The participants may use *any* method and training data to develop their solutions. 

**Track 2**: The partcipants are only allowed to train their methods on the *offline datasets*.

Winners in each track will receive cash prizes and will get a chance to present their innovative solutions during the virtual ceremony.

## Submission site
The competition is run from the following site: [Driving SMARTS Competition submission](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/6618)

### How winners are determined
- Submissions for Track 1 will be automatically evaluated on a test set and the results will be posted on the public leaderboard hosted on CodaLab.
- Top-6 finalists in Track 1 that use offline methods will be invited to submit their training and inference code. The organizers will train and evaluate the models on the withheld dataset. 
- Winners of Track 2 will be determined based on the performance of the models trained by the Organizer.
- The organizers will work with the participants who selected Track 2 to run their training code, participants may be asked to provide additional documentation to facilitate this process.
