## The Competition

Autonomous driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in an autonomous driving competition.


### Codalab Site 

[Driving SMARTS Competition](/TODO/)

### Tasks and evaluation
This competition seeks to advance autonomous driving by developing agents that can drive as quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Data for the competition consists of large-scale naturalistic driving data replayed within [SMARTS](https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS/tree/comp-1) simulation environment. The following typical driving scenarios are tested: cruising, overtaking, merging, left turns at unsignalized intersections and being cut off by another vehicle. These scenarios are mined from the naturalistic data, manipulated and replayed in SMARTS. For some scenarios, interactive background vehicles are added in SMARTS.

Agents will be ranked according to metrics on safety and comfort (smoothness and safe driving), task completion (% of completed scenarios), traffic rule violation, and completion time.
